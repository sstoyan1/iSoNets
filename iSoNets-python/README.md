# Twitter-Search-API-Python
A python implementation of the Twitter Search Example

This Python script is an implementation of it's Java version https://github.com/tomkdickinson/TwitterSearchAPI.

It's suitable as an example of how you can extract Tweets from Twitter, without going through their API and obtaining
theoretically much large datasets.

While written for the Java version, the associated blog post for pagination on Twitter can be found
